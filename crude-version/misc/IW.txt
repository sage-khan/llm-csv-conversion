Intro

[Music]
0:05
so before I was asked to actually
0:08
explain what information operations and
0:10
information warfare is before we get
0:12
started so information operations could
0:15
be seen as a communications campaign if
0:16
you're in the private sector if you're
0:17
doing marketing information warfare is
0:21
basically you know it could be a
0:22
competition between BOTS that are online
0:25
between one party and then the other
0:28
both could be States actors both could
0:31
be non-state actors typically
0:33
information warfare is seen as a part of
0:35
the kinetic warfare and if you're doing
0:36
a lot of stuff against Russia it's a
0:38
part of the hybrid warfare with a
0:40
non-linear warfare that the russian
0:42
foreign minister really likes to talk
0:44
about cool so information warfare
Cognitive Insecurity
0:50
basically exploits cognitive insecurity
0:53
right so we all know what physical
0:55
security is it's protecting ourselves
0:57
physically cognitive security is how do
1:00
you actually protect our minds so
1:02
cognitive insecurity is basically when
1:04
there are flaws in our own cognitive
1:06
security so it typically exists due to
1:09
carelessness just not even caring could
1:11
be also that someone's naive their
1:13
innocent it could be that they have a
1:16
target identity weakness which basically
1:18
means that they're so they're so loyal
1:21
to one identity that they become blind
1:23
to the flaws so you see this a lot with
1:26
Isis with al Qaeda groups and then
1:29
there's also groupthink on average when
1:32
we're they group together like this your
1:34
IQ drops by about 20 points then if you
1:38
are by yourself and so if everyone
1:40
around you if 40% of people around you
1:43
will not yes to an answer that you know
1:45
it's actually wrong most likely you're
1:47
either not gonna speak where you're also
1:49
gonna go yes because everyone around you
1:51
is doing the same thing right and then
1:53
they're also biological neuroscience I'm
1:54
not gonna get into it we want to talk
1:56
about it there are specific hormones
1:58
that are at work that are created when a
2:02
consensus where an echo chamber actually
2:04
occurs and then there's a there are also
2:07
the psychological where the emotional
2:08
imbalance
Information Operations
2:12
all right um actually okay so when it
2:19
comes to comms campaigns that's
2:21
basically an information operation there
2:23
are really three stages right one is
2:25
you're basically tracking and monitoring
2:27
the adversarial propaganda and their il
2:29
campaign so you're looking at who
2:31
they're targeting how they're targeting
2:32
them and the results the second is you
2:35
want to plan your own counter IO
2:36
campaign where your own offensive IO
2:38
campaign basically you look the same
2:41
thing the who the what the how right and
2:43
then the third is you want to monitor
2:45
the effectiveness and the entire time
2:49
you should be monitoring effective the
2:51
effectiveness and we're and we're going
2:53
to come back to this later and so to
2:55
give you a good example of the IO the
2:59
reason why I asked about Harry Potter
3:00
is because so on so this is lower
3:05
baltimore by the way this was when he
3:07
was a kid and that's when he actually
3:08
becomes for Baltimore so I want to
3:11
actually read you an IO campaign okay so
3:14
we all know in the in the original story
3:17
that Harry Potter is a good guy I want
3:20
to read you this version so Harry Potter
3:22
was mistreated and physically and
3:24
psychologically abused as a whorfin his
3:26
parents were killed and he never got the
3:28
closure that he wanted in school he was
3:31
further tormented and bullied by his
3:33
fellow students and even his teachers
3:35
singled him out and treated him unfairly
3:38
so he began taking matters in his own
3:40
hand he began working out and taking
3:43
extra classes to improve his skills he
3:45
also radicalized those closest to him he
3:48
spread his propaganda in person and
3:50
through innovative ways like the coin he
3:53
he continued to do that he also stole
3:57
lied beat people up and jinx them with
3:59
magic with sufficient support he formed
4:01
a mighty militia against the Ministry of
4:04
Magic and he the non-state actor one
4:10
same story right so my background is
4:15
actually in Count von extremism so I
4:16
find this really interesting as a
4:18
radicalization method but that is an IO
4:21
campaign and I and I can
4:24
some of you are nodding while some of
4:26
some others are very skeptical of where
4:29
just said but this is where the level of
4:32
skepticism now you have to get over
4:33
because when you grow up with my version
4:35
in this story this is what you're gonna
4:37
believe right and you're like well
4:39
really like how can he be the good guy
4:41
and so it's really so that's where the
4:45
in cut the cognitive insecurity it's
4:47
very nebulous and the same time is very
4:49
hard to single just one indicator and so
Macro Strategy
4:54
let's just apply that IO campaign that I
4:57
just mentioned right to the three stages
4:59
I'm gonna go through this very quickly
5:00
you'll get the slides later so don't
5:03
worry about reading what's up here so
5:06
the macro strategy level is always about
5:07
the ultimate goals and then the type of
5:10
content and who you're trying to
5:11
influence and how are you going to do is
5:13
the social media is an offline it's a a
5:15
hybrid of both and then your second
Planning Execution
5:19
stage is basically the planning and the
5:20
execution right you want your comeback
5:22
and so it's basically the same thing
5:27
that you're looking for right so you
5:29
want to know your goals and I want to
5:31
talk about the basic goals of
5:32
information warfare so the ultimate goal
5:35
is to beat your adversary it's pretty
5:38
simple but there are really four ways
5:40
you can do it you can control the
5:41
content and how he spreads so this could
5:43
be censorship there are where you could
5:47
do official channels for for anonymity
5:50
god manipulation which is basically we
5:54
can think of RT that's a good example
5:56
and certain content as organically
5:59
whirring organically promoted so that's
6:01
a distraction right so one of the best
6:04
cases I've ever heard is when um
6:07
Prince Harry who's getting married to
6:10
Megan - Megan Markel okay so when that
6:14
story became the news right guess which
6:18
story got bumped down Theresa May and
6:21
her and her inability to deliver brexit
6:23
right and the joke am on this i/o
6:27
community was that that was a perfect
6:29
distraction because everyone's like oh
6:31
my gosh they're getting married this is
6:32
great like she's half black this is
6:34
wonderful black people can't be princess
6:37
it
6:37
like all that stuff and and and there
6:40
and there was a rumor that within the
6:43
prime minister's office someone
6:44
literally said oh thank god I mean that
6:46
news story came out because now we're
6:48
not we don't have to talk about Theresa
6:50
Mays unpopularity right and then the
6:54
fourth is basically disinformation and
6:56
misinformation which all the other
6:57
panels have talked about so once you
7:00
have your your goal you can now look at
7:04
how to do it oh how to do it and
7:08
then you also want to want to monitor
7:10
the effectiveness and so that brings us
7:14
to the third is mo e and Mo P which is
7:17
still the lingo that I'm going to use so
Monitoring Evaluation
7:20
when you're monitoring the evaluation
7:23
nobody really does it nobody really
7:25
knows how we've literally spent billions
7:28
of dollars right doing IO campaigns and
7:31
we don't really know how effective they
7:34
are and a big part is it's really hard
7:37
to measure the lack of something but
7:40
second is also how do you make sure that
7:42
something like click-through rate where
7:43
the very surface social social media
7:46
metrics like engagements likes shares
7:50
how do they actually converts into
7:53
behavioral change or a change in
7:55
attitudes and so this is where I feel
7:58
like the space is lacking and something
8:00
that big data can actually help us
8:02
tremendously with because if so if I
8:06
were Expedia or if I were Google
8:08
advertising and my clients Expedia and
8:10
they're paying me a lot of money to run
8:13
their advertising if I go in there with
8:15
a click-through rate I will literally be
8:17
laughed out of the room because the
8:19
private sector is a lot more rigorous
8:20
with their metric I will have to have
8:23
the lifetime value over a customer
8:24
acquisition right to continue to have
8:27
them as a client but for some reason in
8:29
this military in this defense space
8:32
we're totally fine with the
8:33
click-through rate but what does that
8:34
actually mean and so a few other things
8:39
I would do want to touch on this is the
8:41
first is a lot of us do story base
8:43
they're great but they're also very
8:46
forced and you and in organic and so I
8:48
was D radicalizing you'll not see
8:51
up in the Scandinavia region and I just
8:54
remember that when we had to go and ply
8:58
for funding you know we would go to our
9:00
the people that we were working with and
9:03
we literally asked them are you like are
9:06
you more likely or less likely to become
9:08
to read to read become a neo-nazi right
9:11
no one's gonna be like yes I would like
9:14
to continue to be on you a neo-nazi
9:16
Alice there you know firmly firmly loyal
9:19
to the cause right and so I was like
9:22
okay well how do you actually know that
9:23
we did our job we don't really know the
9:26
second is hard to read people's minds
9:28
and then they're missed trends due to
9:30
our brains limited capacity to compute
9:32
datasets and that's why we need big data
9:35
so big data essentially what people are
9:38
posting publicly at their volition and
9:40
which means that's more organic we can
9:42
also look at how their online behaviors
9:44
have actually changed based on the way
9:46
that they engage with different posts
9:48
and then the monitoring should also be
9:50
done with more of a scientific
9:52
methodology with a be split tests where
9:55
if you're into stats you can use the
9:57
multi armed bandits and then the third
9:59
is you know Big Data allows us to look
10:01
at data points at a community city and
10:03
etc levels right beyond just the
10:06
individual levels so I'm going to run
10:08
you through an IO campaign we actually
10:10
did against Jay Chou is long so Jaysh
10:13
al-islam recently became more popular
10:16
but there are a there a Salafist group
10:18
they have not been branded as a
10:20
terrorist group but they do want Sharia
10:21
law and they're in Syria they used to be
10:24
the rebels that hold East gouta now they
10:27
have been more they've been drastically
10:30
weakened by the SAR regime so this is
Influence
10:34
Jaysh al-islam so we decided to look at
10:38
their influence first right because the
10:40
first stage is you got to look at your
10:41
competitors so we're so they're
10:43
competing against a free syrian army on
10:46
where our ashram and then Hitoshi isil
10:50
and then there's Jaysh al-islam so you
10:52
can tell that educational Islam which is
10:54
the Purple Line they have actually
10:56
steadily increased their influence
10:58
because social media platforms I know
11:01
there are people from Twitter on
11:02
Facebook here um they don't really know
11:04
much about
11:05
so their stuff is so out there right
11:07
they actually have 28 Twitter accounts
11:10
into in 28 different languages and and
11:13
there are the official channels and so
11:16
we said okay we want to do an an IO
11:19
campaign to persuade people to not
11:20
support Jay Chou's lon so we are going
11:24
to do an a/b split test the age is going
11:26
to be your controlled right and your B
11:29
is going to be your experimental so we
11:31
create this narrative and then we and
11:33
then we send them out because this was
11:35
just a test right we wanted to make sure
11:38
that we're reaching people with the
11:42
influence score of around I think 50 to
11:45
70 because once you get above 70 to 100
11:48
those are a tier one and you don't want
11:50
to send them stuff unless you're a
11:52
positively sure that your narrative
11:54
actually works so we did the a/b split
11:59
test automatically so this was done
12:01
actually using machine learning and then
12:04
we waited two weeks later we saw this so
Machine Learning
12:09
you're so the Jewish followers are so
12:12
your control group are in the red and
12:14
then your experimental are in the blue
12:18
wait actually sorry it's flipped
12:21
um I apologize so the blue is your
12:23
controlled and then and then your red is
12:25
the is the experimental and so we can
12:29
see that it kind of fluctuates right and
12:31
this is really important because so when
12:34
we first are our pilot in Bosnia we did
12:36
it at a very untimely we had a very
12:39
untimely timing which was that it was
12:41
during I eat and then it was also the
12:44
siege of Aleppo so everyone's
12:46
radicalization score went straight up
12:48
and so so we decided okay well we need
12:52
to actually control for these real
12:55
events that are happening that might
12:57
actually skew the data so this is what
13:00
you saw and at the end you can actually
13:02
see that the radical posts that people
13:05
have been engaging with actually dropped
13:07
so using machine learning we basically
13:10
created something called a radical post
13:12
and this so is basically we can gather
13:14
all of you everyone's activity publicly
13:17
of
13:17
available activities and then start to
13:20
see okay they're actually starting to
13:22
engage less with radical posts so this
13:24
is based on the number of radical posts
13:28
when we can look at the percentage of
13:30
radical posts and you can see that
13:32
there's a huge drop in experimental now
13:35
finally something called a
13:36
radicalization score which we create a
13:38
fun ml which basically shows the
13:41
likelihood that someone's online
13:43
behaviors match the online behaviors of
13:46
previously known violent extremists and
13:51
that went down so Tech has basically
Conclusion
13:55
made information warfare asymmetrical
13:58
there's a big war for data so raw data
14:01
as well as the analysis but actually
14:04
want to make a controversial statement
14:05
which is that I at this point it's not
14:08
really about how much raw data you can
14:10
get I think right now the words on the
14:12
analysis if you're the NSA you're
14:14
sitting on trillions of data points it
14:16
doesn't matter you know if you have them
14:19
if you do if you don't do the proper
14:21
analysis on them they're useless and
14:24
then also understanding and using new
14:27
tech experiments um
14:30
I'm gonna skip that part and then so
14:32
this is what so this is basically the
14:35
conclusion it's a very happy conclusion
14:36
the information warfare is more
14:38
dangerous than the arms race because
14:39
there's no meet mutually assured
14:41
destruction right so there's nothing to
14:44
stop us from having a bot war with
14:47
Russia right now the entire internet
14:50
could be flooded with BOTS and we still
14:52
have to use the internet until you know
14:54
quantum Internet becomes a thing in like
14:57
ten years and just to end at the CIA the
15:06
CIA recently has a new director who is
15:10
who has been who has made statements
15:13
supporting torture and one of the things
15:17
that you know we always talk about is
15:19
that psychological torture more people
15:22
prefer psychologic
15:23
more people prefer physical torture over
15:25
psychological torture which makes this
15:28
statement all the more dire
15:31
I'm done thank you
15:35
