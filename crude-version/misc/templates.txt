What are the account details and transaction summaries found in a1.pdf? Provide a breakdown of the opening and closing balances, total debits and credits from a1.pdf. Do not miss a single transaction. Do as I am asking you to do. Do not make up information. Give me transactions contained in a1.pdf. Before listing transactions, list down client name or account title, bank name, opening and closing date of statement along with the figures. If there is no value written on debit or credit for particular transaction write zero. Structure your output in a way that it looks like a proper summarised csv table like format containing all data from all pages of a1.pdf. Write down all the transactions contained in a1.pdf in this format: Date,Transaction-Particulars,debit,credit,balance.Remember that before listing all transactions, write down the opening balance and once you end all transactions, write down closing balance. Then write down total sum of debits, credits and balance.

Extract and compile account information and transactions from "a1.pdf". Start with account details (client name/title, bank, opening/closing dates, opening balance). List transactions in this sequence:

- Transaction date
- Details
- Debit amount ("0" if none)
- Credit amount ("0" if none)
- Balance post-transaction

Present the data in a structured, table-like format akin to CSV, including opening balance, each transaction, closing balance, and the sum totals of debits, credits, and the final balance. Ensure completeness and accuracy, reflecting only the content of "a1.pdf".
